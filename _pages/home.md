# Workshop at a Glance
This workshop will be an **hybrid event** taking place on <b>June 3</b> from **8:45am** to **5:00pm**. The session will cover invited talks and a panel discussion.

# Call for presentations
Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming scientific discovery,
giving rise to the emerging paradigm of *AI for Science*—a catalyst for
innovation at unprecedented speeds. Advanced AI algorithms empower
researchers to analyze complex, large-scale datasets, uncovering hidden
patterns that guide experimental design and decision-making. However,
these AI technologies typically demand intensive computational
resources, relying on high-performance computing (HPC) systems and
hardware accelerators for efficient execution.

To meet these demands, modern computing infrastructure increasingly
integrates parallel and distributed systems, blending heterogeneous
hardware, algorithms, and computational approaches to surpass the
limitations of conventional supercomputing. In scientific applications,
clusters of accelerators (e.g., GPUs, FPGAs) are now indispensable for
training and deploying neural network models. The iterative nature of AI
training, coupled with the massive scale of datasets, has further
solidified AI as a "killer application" for parallel computing,
distributed systems, and HPC—driving significant research in these fields.

This workshop aims to bridge the gap between the parallel/distributed
computing community and AI for Science practitioners, showcasing
cutting-edge solutions to performance challenges. We invite
contributions that demonstrate how AI methodologies can optimize
computational efficiency and advance scientific discovery.
